# Description

So, that's lightweight binary, what allow you to get an unlimited power with Trial version of nvk plugins, and use it for lifetime.

# Installation

### From github

Install [ReaPack](https://reapack.com)

Copy and paste the following URL in Extensions -> ReaPack -> Import repositories...

```
https://github.com/L0wl/nkvToolsBundleLicense/raw/index/index.xml
```

### From license file

Initially you need a clean version of Reaper, where you have never installed, or at least opened any plugin from nvk (You can get it [here](https://nvk.tools/)). That can be distributed in any of the Bundles. Select an Trial version of any plugin, what you want, and install it!

After that - don't try to run Reaper, and plugin instead, because license is not replaced.

Go to `Drive:/Path/To/Reaper/Scripts/nvk-ReaScripts/SHARED/Data` and replace original `license.dat`

> [!NOTE]
> Make sure, you already make a copy of original `license.dat`, in other wise you need to reinstall reaper and plugin instead.
>
> Simple way to do that - add to name of `license.dat` (original license), some extra character(s). For example: `license.dat` -> `0license.dat` (You can found it by previous path)

So, in next step is - Download the [license](https://github.com/L0wl/nkvToolsBundleLicense/archive/refs/heads/license.zip) branch, and unpack the license.dat file into the original license file location

After that - Open Reaper, and run plugin, what you want ([nvk family plugins](https://nvk.tools/))

Some "Enter license key" message are shown, so close it!

After that - you will see another window, with trial period start, with 999999999999 days. Apply it! (Click Yes)

After that you will see plugin window, and license now working pretty well!

Soo you got additional window, with crack credits, and unfollowed instruction, what can be available for old versions of crack (Non public versions. You can skip this window, and press Don't show again checkbox, to disapear it for lifetime of plugin usage)

Now you have an unlimited Trial License that is as powerful as the premium products and unlocks the unprecedented potential of nkw Tools for you to get best user experience and get. Open up new horizons of possibilities with nkv products, and use this power to work faster by performing routine tasks with automated nkv tools
